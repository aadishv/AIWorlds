**The eval itself**

YOLOv5s model trained on ~100 images obtained by the Purdue SIGBots; data was transformed to a 235-image dataset. Trained for 100 epochs on a Google Colab notebook with T4 GPU. Model is stored in `best.pt`.

The original ~200 images used for training (the other ~30 are for testing and validation) constitute the eval.
